# Detecting-COVID-19-with-Chest-X-Ray-using-PyTorch
Coursera: Using a ResNet-18 model and train it on a COVID-19 Radiography dataset. This dataset has nearly 3000 Chest X-Ray scans which are categorized in three classes - Normal, Viral Pneumonia and COVID-19. The objective in this project is to create an image classification model that can predict Chest X-Ray scans that belong to one of the three classes with a reasonably high accuracy.Note: this dataset, and the model trained in the project, can not be used to diagnose COVID-19 or Viral Pneumonia. 


Learning objectives:

Create custom Dataset and DataLoader in PyTorch <br />
Train a ResNet-18 model in PyTorch to perform Image Classification
